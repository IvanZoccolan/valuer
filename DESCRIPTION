Title: Pricing of  variable annuities
Version: 1.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Ivan", "Zoccolan", email = "ivan.zoccolan@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides R6 pricing engines for variable annuities life insurance
    contracts. These engines implement different models to simulate the
    financial and demographic sources of risk. A simple Monte Carlo method
    is used to price the contract in case the policyholder cannot surrender
    while Least Squares Monte Carlo is used if the insured can surrender.
    A state-dependent fee structure with single barrier is also implemented.
