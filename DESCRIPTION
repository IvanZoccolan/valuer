Description: An implementation of the static and mixed approach to estimate
    the value of Variable Annuities Life Insurance contracts via ordinary and
    least squares Monte Carlo methods. It follows the general framework proposed
    by Bacinello, Millossovich, Olivieri, Pitacco. It also provides functions to find
    the fair fee of a VA contract. State-dependent fees are considered.
